### Project: API and platform for managing custom Data Stream ingestion jobs ###
This platform is a meta-solution for my employer that offers a bring-your-own-container stream processing engine to internal engineering teams.
* Stack: Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, RabbitMQ, Docker, AWS, S3, Kubernetes
* My role: Architect and lead engineer on the project
* Value added:
  * Facilitated dozens of new custom back-end processes while avoiding the overhead of traditional service hosting and maintenance
  * Easy horizontal scaling using Docker/OCI images and Kubernetes - major resource savings when not in demand
  * Several new revenue streams for the company including usage-based billing that can be passed on to the customer

### Project: Medical Office EHR System Back-end Modernization and Migration to the Cloud ###
This project consisted of migrating archaic SQL-based business logic (stored procedures) into modern services written in C# and .NET Core. It also integrated with third-party EHR systems while ensuring compliance with HIPAA and other EHR requirements.
* Stack: C#/.NET Core, Microsoft SQL Server, Docker
* My role: Senior Engineer
* Value added:
  * Vastly improved system reliability and maintainability by migrating business logic out of the database layer and into a new .NET Core service layer
  * Reduction in hosting costs by migrating API services from .NET Framework to .NET Core multiplatform docker images

### Project: Medical Office EHR System Front-end UX Modernization ###
This project consisted of migrating ActiveX applications and Windows-based WPF desktop applications to a new platform-agnostic web-based UX layer.
* Stack: Javascript, Typescript, Angular, React, HTML5, CSS3/Sass
* My role: Senior Engineer
* Value added:
  * Improved UX speed, function, and modularity
  * Expansion of user base as more platforms were supported (particularly tablets as they became more common in medical practices)
