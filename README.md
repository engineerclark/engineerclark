Hi there! I'm Michael.
==============================
I'm a Software Craftsman with 15 years of experience crafting software.

## A few of my current software-related fascinations as of mid-2023 ##

### Kotlin for Server-side applications ###
Kotlin is a much more robust and expressive language than both Java and C# for developing [server-side applications and services](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/server-overview.html). Kotlin's interoperability with Java and easy learning curve make it my language of choice for all new JVM projects.

https://kotlinlang.org/

### Functional + OOP projects, Reactive Programming, Declarative Code ###
I am a proponent of combining the best of both Functional and OOP paradigms.

Both .NET and JVM ecosystems also have great extensions for a Reactive, Declarative approach to asynchronous, non-blocking software development.
- JVM: [Reactive Streams](https://www.reactive-streams.org/), [Project Reactor](https://projectreactor.io/), [Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html), [Kotlin Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html)
- .NET: [Reactive Extensions for .NET (Rx.NET)](https://github.com/dotnet/reactive)

## Q&A ##

### Why do you emphasize Software Craftsmanship? ###
For me, software development is more than a job or an engineering discipline. Writing good software is my lifelong [craft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_craftsmanship). I apply my best efforts to my projects and take pride in the results. I strive to create software that not only works but also is beautiful and elegantly fits the needs of my clients and target users.

My practice of this craft will always have room for improvement. I enjoy being part of a community of skilled engineers and craftspeople from whom I am continually learning, and to whom I impart the lessons I learn while practicing the craft.

### What are you currently working on as of 2023? ###
Professionally, I work full-time as a software engineer and consultant. Most of my effort these days is dedicated to creating AI-driven data experiences for users.

Individually, I am working on:
- Event-driven Scala concept applications - to further my experience with Functional Programming on the JVM
- FOSS Second-Brain tools - A set of simple and elegant "Second Brain"-style notebook tools that provide an alternative to closed and subscription-based services


## Books ##
Some books that have helped me become a better Software Engineer and Craftsman.  I recommend them to engineers at all levels of experience.
