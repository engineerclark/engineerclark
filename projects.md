Project Spotlights
==============================
Summaries for a few projects I'm particularly proud of.

## Project: API and platform for managing custom Data Stream ingestion jobs ##
![Kotlin](images/badges/kotlin.svg)
![Java](images/badges/java.svg)
![Spring Boot](images/badges/springboot.svg)
![MySQL](images/badges/mysql.svg)
![RabbitMQ](images/badges/rabbitmq.svg)
![Docker](images/badges/docker.svg)
![AWS](images/badges/aws.svg)
![Kubernetes](images/badges/kubernetes.svg)

A meta-solution for my employer that offers a bring-your-own-container stream processing engine to internal engineering teams.
* Stack: Kotlin, Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, RabbitMQ, Docker, AWS, S3, Kubernetes
* Service Architecture: Clean/Hexagonal + Event-Driven architecture within a SOA system
* My role: Architect and lead engineer on the project
* Value added:
  * Facilitated dozens of new custom back-end processes while avoiding the overhead of traditional service hosting and maintenance
  * Easy horizontal scaling using Docker/OCI images and Kubernetes - major resource savings when not in demand
  * Several new revenue streams for the company including consumption-based billing for data ingestion that can be passed on to the customer

## Project: Medical Office EHR System Back-end Modernization and Migration to the Cloud ##
![C#](images/badges/c-sharp.svg)
![.NET](images/badges/dotnet.svg)
![SQL Server](images/badges/sqlserver.svg)
![Docker](images/badges/docker.svg)

Migrated archaic SQL-based business logic (stored procedures) into modern services written in C# and .NET Core. It also integrated with third-party EHR systems while ensuring compliance with HIPAA and other EHR requirements.
* Stack: C#/.NET Core, Microsoft SQL Server, Docker
* Service Architecture: Multi-tier services within a Microservice architecture
* My role: Senior Engineer
* Value added:
  * Vastly improved system reliability and maintainability by migrating business logic out of the database layer and into a new .NET Core service layer
  * Reduction in hosting costs by migrating API services from .NET Framework to .NET Core multiplatform docker images

## Project: Medical Office EHR System Front-end UX Modernization ##
![Typescript](images/badges/typescript.svg)
![Javascript](images/badges/javascript.svg)
![Angular](images/badges/angular.svg)
![React](images/badges/react.svg)
![HTML5](images/badges/html5.svg)
![CSS3](images/badges/css3.svg)
![Sass](images/badges/sass.svg)

Migrated Windows-based EHR and Patient Management applications to a new platform-agnostic web-based UX layer.
* Stack: Javascript, Typescript, Angular, React, HTML5, CSS3/Sass
* Application Architectures: Single-Page Applications with MVC architecture (Angular), Component architecture (React)
* My role: Senior Engineer
* Value added:
  * Improved UX speed, function, and modularity
  * Expansion of user base as more platforms were supported (particularly tablets as they became more common in medical practices)

## Project: Distributed BI Content Publication Service ##
![Kotlin](images/badges/kotlin.svg)
![Spring Boot](images/badges/springboot.svg)
![Project Reactor](images/badges/projectreactor.svg)
![Apache Kafka](images/badges/kafka.svg)
![RabbitMQ](images/badges/rabbitmq.svg)
![MySQL](images/badges/mysql.svg)
![Redis](images/badges/redis.svg)
![AWS](images/badges/aws.svg)

A solution for customers to publish datasets and BI dashboard content to subscribers. Data updates are streamed to subscribers and are reflected on their dashboards in near real-time.

* Stack: Kotlin, Spring Boot, Project Reactor, Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, MySQL, Redis, AWS
* Service Architecture: Event-Driven + Reactive + Hexagonal Architecture within a SOA system
* My role: Architect and lead engineer on the project
* Value added:
  * Saves many man hours previously spent exporting and re-creating data-driven BI dashboards
  * Provides organizations with a way to distribute living data visualizations rather than static snapshots
  * Uses a distributed architecture to avoid a central point of failure or degradation of resources during high traffic periods
  * Low latency, parallel processing, and efficient resource usage achieved through a Reactive Programming approach (Project Reactor)

## Project: Back-end Service Integration with OpenAI, Amazon Sagemaker, Hugging Face ##
![Kotlin](images/badges/kotlin.svg)
![Java](images/badges/java.svg)
![Spring Boot](images/badges/springboot.svg)
![MySQL](images/badges/mysql.svg)
![OpenAI](images/badges/openai.svg)
![Sagemaker](images/badges/sagemaker.svg)
![Python](images/badges/python.svg)
![Kubernetes](images/badges/kubernetes.svg)
![Docker](images/badges/docker.svg)
![AWS](images/badges/aws.svg)

A service abstraction layer to wrap multiple AI/ML providers and create new products on top of them.
* Stack: Kotlin, Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, OpenAI, Amazon Sagemaker, Hugging Face, Python, Kubernetes, Docker, AWS
* Service Architecture: Clean Architecture within a SOA system
* My role: Senior Engineer
* Value added:
  * Integrated with AI/ML providers to offer new AI-based services such as text-to-sql and other text generation assistance
  * Provided a platform for customers to interact with a knowledge base and their own data with natural language
  * Enabled customers to decouple their AI processes from specific vendors and models
